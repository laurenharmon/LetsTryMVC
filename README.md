Let'sTryMVC is my capstone project for the LaunchCode (CoderGirl) 2021 Cohort. Using MVC5, Entity Framework, ASP.NET Core and MySQL 
I've created a simple website for a fictional e-commerce company that incorporates login/logout functionality, picture upload capabilities, 
friend-groups, and puchasing functionality for a fluid, uncomplicated user experience.
