Let's Try MVC is my capstone project for the LaunchCode (CoderGirl) 2021 Cohort. Using MVC5, Entity Framework, ASP.NET Core and MySQL 
I've created a simple website for a fictional e-commerce company that incorporates login/logout functionality, picture upload capabilities, 
friend-groups, and purchasing functionality for a fluid, uncomplicated user experience.


The landing page before authentication. User has access to purchasing functionality only.

Once logged in, the User has access to all other functionality. Show here are the picture uploading and display functionality. Photos are connected to the
related product tags ("Spring 2021", "Summer 2021", etc). Photos have Create, Read, and Delete functionality.

The User can add and delete friends from a list of all possible users from the database. This creates links to friends' pictures and delete functionality.

The cart is stored using sessions. A User can change quantity dynamically in the shopping cart section.

Show here is the purchasing aspect of the application. If logged in, a User can access all previous orders from the Orders tab, or from the "My Orders"
button after purchase.
